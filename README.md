# VSV-sim

## Files
`simulation.py` - the actual simulation, calculations-only and graphics are different functions

`combine-tifs.ijm` - combine the TIF files generated by `simulation.py` into stacks

## Notes
Change directory paths in each of the files as needed.

`combine-*` are both ImageJ scripts.

The output TIF files are pretty large, so use `combine-tifs.ijm` to combine separate batches. Put all files to be combined into one folder and run `combine-tifs` for that folder. If stacks are named `{NAME}{NUM}` and they are in the same folder, they will be run in the order of `{NUM}`.
