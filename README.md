# VSV-sim

## Files
`run.py` - the main script to run the simulation. Example call for computing w/o visuals:
`python run.py --n_particles 1000 --total_time 3600 --p_driv 0.03 --headless`

Call `python run.py --help` for more options.

`simulation.py` - the actual simulation, calculations-only and graphics are different functions

`analysis.py` - various analysis scripts, feel free to add/modify as needed

`combine-tifs.ijm` - combine the TIF files generated by `simulation.py` into stacks

## Module requirements
 - `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipykernel pyside6 tqdm`
 - Pillow: `pip install --upgrade Pillow --global-option="build_ext" --global-option="--enable-xcb"`

## Notes
Change directory paths in each of the files as needed.

`combine-*` are both ImageJ scripts.

The output TIF files are pretty large, so use `combine-tifs.ijm` to combine separate batches. Put all files to be combined into one folder and run `combine-tifs` for that folder. If stacks are named `{NAME}{NUM}` and they are in the same folder, they will be run in the order of `{NUM}`.
